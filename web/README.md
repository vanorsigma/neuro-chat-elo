## Neuro Chat Elo Website

Here be the frontend for the elo leaderboards. Our community is filled with talented devs, so if you have anything to contribute we'd love to see it.

## Developing

Protobuf types are not bundled with this repository, so must be generated by the developer or else your IDE will get angry.
Our proto definitions are stored in the `models/` directory if you want to make changes, but be aware the rust crates also rely on them.

```bash
npm run compileProtos
```

To do a full build of the website run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```
