Ever wanted to flex how much of a chatter you are? Or perhaps you've
always wanted to quantify how much you love Neuro-sama? Maybe you
loved the elo stream and want to see some kind of competitive aspect
to your chatting shenanigans?

**Status**: Public Alpha

Please see the
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/vanorsigma/projects/1) to find out
what is being worked on. Broadly, the project has the following goals:

- Be a fun stream companion that is impartial and general to all
  events
- Assist the [Neurocord](https://discord.com/invite/neurosama)
  community in garnering interest in events, such as the Pixel Canvas.

The project has the following major features incoming:
- Live Leaderboard calculations, in preparation for the next subathon
- Opting out integration for those who don't want to participate
- Special event leaderboards
